## 1. Terminologies


#### Class:

* _Classes_ are blueprints for objects. For example, a `Student` class is the blueprint for making a `Student` object.

#### Object:
* _Objects_ are instances of classes; a student object is one actual `Student` that exists in memory.

#### Properties:
* _Properties_ are characteristics of classes, such as the name, age, and grade of a `Student`.

#### Methods:
* _Methods_, also called _member functions_, are the functionality of the class.
Methods are what you can "do" with the object. For example, you can `calculateAverage()` of a `Student`'s marks.

#### Interface:
* An _interface_ is a specification that a class can implement. For example, extracurricular activities are common to objects other than students, and these activities generally happen in similar ways for different objects. So you could have an interface called `StudentActivities` that defines a `participate()` method. The `Student` class could implement the `StudentActivities` interface to allow students to participate in various activities.

#### Packages:
* _Packages_ are a way to group related code to keep it organized, or to make a library of code. Once a package is created, you can use `import` to allow you to directly reference classes in that package. For example, you could have a package called `edu.school` that contains the `Student` class, `Marks` class, and `StudentIQ` class.
